# Code, Coffee and Crafts #

This repo contains the code I wrote for my Three Cs series as part of Project P.
The code in this repo tries to demonstrate some lesser understood parts of programming at lower
levels and tries to demonstrate them in an easy to understand way and also aims to be a demonstration
of neat stuff in general. Hope you find it useful *-- Lagg*

# TODO #

The following is a list of lesson plans for future videos in no particular order.

* Tic-tac toe game for assholes - forgot what I meant by this.
  * Extension language APIs and libs
* Testcase of a bug parallel to what occurred with heartbleed that demonstrates why the hysteria and conspiracy theories are stupid (nullterminators.c may be involved)
* Endianness
* Trees, what they are at their core.
* Why graphical charmap tiles are awesome
* Nature of the preprocessor - forgot what I meant by this. Probably explanation of the stage in which preprocessor macros are expanded
* The joys of reverse engineering, pain in the ass but oh so rewarding in the end. Will likely involve a protocol or file format from a video game.
