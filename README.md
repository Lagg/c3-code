# Coffee, Code and Crafts #

This repo contains the code I wrote for my Three Cs series as part of Project P.
The code in this repo tries to demonstrate some lesser understood parts of programming at lower
levels and tries to demonstrate them in an easy to understand way and also aims to be a demonstration
of neat stuff in general. Hope you find it useful *-- Lagg*
